# GitHub Action: Prerelease Microservice

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
<!-- action-docs-description -->
## Description

< GitHub Action to compute a prerelease version based on the latest release version and the number of commits since the latest release. This will also generate a docker tag based on the computed version if the label `prerelease` is specified on the PR.
<!-- action-docs-description -->
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Configuration

### Step1: Set any [Semantic Release Configuration](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration) in your repository.

### Step2: [Add Secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) in your repository for the [Semantic Release Authentication](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/ci-configuration.md#authentication) Environment Variables.

### Step3: Add a [Workflow File](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) to your repository to create custom automated processes.

## Usage

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Action semantic release
    uses: open-turo/actions-jvm/prerelease-msvc@v1
    with:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**IMPORTANT**: `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not have the required permissions to operate on protected branches.
If you are using this action for protected branches, replace `GITHUB_TOKEN`
with [Personal Access Token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
If using the `@semantic-release/git` plugin for protected branches, avoid persisting credentials as part
of `actions/checkout@v4` by setting the parameter `persist-credentials: false`. This credential does not have the
required permission to operate on protected branches.
